The name comes from their lifestyle of eternal Nomads. This unique species evolved, not like the most, on planet surface, but in outer space. They've learned how to use minerals floating across the stars to create their technology. There is no such place like their \"home planet\". Instead of that, there are huge fleets traveling trough galaxy.\n\n----------------- FEATURES ------------------\nThe current version (1.5) contains:\n\n- completely new race of space travellers\n- new technology design based on \"virtual particles\"\n- unique ship design with themed interior\n- new themed furniture, like tables, beds, lamps and many other\n- some guns with traditional and new mechanics\n- face paintings - they are like tatoos on face, but can be changed and dyed!\n- very OP tech called \"luminous wings\", which allows you to travel with insane speed in any environment\n- NPCs and colonists who can be hired\n\n------------------- MORE -----------------\nThis mod is still under development. It means that I am planning to add much more content, like \"solar sails\" technology and dungeons, like mentioned above fleets or even space battles. Nobody knows what the future will bring...\n\nThe tech becomes available after completeing the obstacle course for getting Distortion Sphere tech. If you want to have it on the character who has already completed that mission, you can get it by writing a command \"/enabletech glider\" (you must be in admin mode to do so).\n\nIf you find any issues, please contact me (I am sure you will find something, I just can't eliminate them all alone).\nAny method will do, but the contact through GitHub repo will be appreciated.\n\nENJOY!",
